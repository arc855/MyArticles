Hello Everyone,
This is my first writing. Firstly I would like to introduce myself to everyone. My name is **Archana GS** from Bilavani.
Today I want to talk about my experience on my motorcycle.  
I'm person who likes to ride motorcycle, unfortunately we did not have motorcycle not even a bike at our home.  
Interesting question is how did I learnt to ride?  
 
when I was four year old, I have moved to my grandma house. I was there till 7th grade. I remember one thing ,a milk man used to come on bike to deliver milk. 
Every evening at 7PM was waiting for him in the front yard. As soon as he get down from bike, I used to take his bike and try to push it because it was quite big bike.
This became routine for me,with in a month I learned to peddle. My legs were very short so I was not able to sit and peddle. I completed 7th grade then moved to my village for high school,
There we got a cycle from government scheme, I already knew  how to ride bicycle. I was desiring to ride motorcycle.  
One day my friend's father had a Scooty. I asked them to teach how to ride scooty. They explained me what is accelerator ,brake lever,where to insert the key and all.
As I already had experience in riding bike it was easy for me. I learned Scooty also. I was not satisfied,
I was eager to learn motorcycle with gear. My brother had Splendor Plus 100 cc, whenever I was free, I used to sit on it and try to move it on a sloppy area, while coming back used to get down and pushing hard because of elevation. This helped me to get better balance on vehicle.
I went to chitradurga for first year Engineering holidays.There my uncle taught me about gearing system, accelerator, break,clutch. I practiced in a big ground.  

Even though I finished studies and joined for work , we did not have motor cycle at our home. One day I decided to buy it for my father. Me and my brother purchased motorcycle in shimogga. we were late today it was around 8.30 in night , we have to go back to our place which 75KM away from shimogga. we drove and reached at 10.30 in night . My parents came out and asked us , who's this motorcycle ?
we were like ours only, they surprised and happy about It. 
Next morning me and my brother were going to near by places, I was about to take out motorcycle from house.. my mother came and said, could you please handover bike key to your brother?
Me: why what happened ?
Mother : Nothing happened , just give it to him.  

can you think why she is said like that ?  

Me:  I brought it mom, I will ride .
Mother You brought it but you are not supposed to ride it.
Even she knows that I ride motorcycle, something is triggering her to say that.   

Is that because of my **gender**?. 

People thinks that women are not capable of doing some kind of work. Even if boys are smaller than girls age, parents will send out boy with girl, because he is male.  

One day I was going to market , my mom told me to go with my cousin brother on his bike. I told her, I have leave our bike for its 3rd service, then she told my brother to take our bike and go archana also will come with you.I strictly told I'm alone going to market nobody is coming with.

From childhood I was waiting for this moment to come , like we should have our own vehicle and I should ride it. Because of my gender should I stop riding my motorcycle ? should I cut my wings and sit inside kitchen ? 

NO , I'm not ready for this..

Now I'm learning car driving yey.!!
