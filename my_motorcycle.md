Hello Everyone,
This is my first writing. Firstly I would like to introduce me to you all. My name is **Archana GS** from Bilavani.
It is a small village in Shivamogga which is called as malenada hebbagilu in kannda. Today I want to talk about my experience with my motorcycle.
I'm person who likes to ride motorcycle, unfortunately we did not have one in our home, not even bike. Interesting question is how did I learnt to ride?
when I was at the age of 4 I moved to my grand ma house.I studied there only form pre KG to seventh. I remeber one thing ,I was 9 year old kid then,a milk man used to come on bike to deliver milk Every day . 
Every evening at 7'oclock I was waiting for him in the front yard. As soon as he get down from bike and coming to deliver milk , I used to take his bike and try to push it up because it was quite big bike.
this became routine for me,with in a month I learnt to ride but not by sitting on it, because my legs were very short. I completed 7th grade then moved to my village for high school,
there we got a cycle from government scheme, I already knew to ride i was desiring to ride motorcycle. Now what i did was,One day my friend's father came to school 
on saturday by scooty. by the time our school already over I asked him to teach to ride scooty.They explained me what is accelaration ,brake lever,where to insert the key and all..
then taught me to ride, as i was known to ride bike it was easy for me. I learnt scooty also not like perfectly but yeah i can ride now. I was not satisfied with that also ,
now i was eager to learn motocycle with gear, My brother had splender pluse 100cc, whenever I was free and it is at home , I used to sit on it and try to move without starting it
on a sloppy area, while coming back used to get down and pushing hard beacuse of elevation. why I was doing this beacuse I did not had key , this helped me to get better balance on vehicle.
I went to chitradurga for first year enginnering holidays. At that time my uncle taught me about gearing system, accelerator, break,clutch. I practiced in a big ground. 
As I grow my desires on riding vehicle also growing..
Even though i finished studies and joined for work , we did not have motor cycle at our home. One day i decided to buy it for my father.
